With each release we will be adding more Data Vault 2.0 table templates, helpful macros and productivity enhancements.
We hope to tailor new features to the requirements of our community, making the package 
the best, and most useful it can be.

We will be releasing changes incrementally, so you can reap the benefits as soon as features are developed.

## Manage metadata at scale

We are developing a new CLI utility to generate and automate more of your Data Vault 2.0 and dbtvault project. 
 
The planned features for this tool include:

- Generating documentation placeholders (YAML, Markdown)
- Generate dbtvault models (.sql files with calls to dbtvault macros).
- Plugins for enterprise tools such as Erwin DM, WhereScape, VaultSpeed and more, to generate dbtvault models.

Development is still ongoing, and is still in the very early stages.
