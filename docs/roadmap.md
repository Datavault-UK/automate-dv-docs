With each release we will be adding more Data Vault 2.0 table templates, helpful macros and productivity enhancements.
We hope to tailor new features to the requirements of our community, making the package 
the best, and most useful it can be.

We will be releasing changes incrementally, so you can reap the benefits as soon as features are developed.

## Manage metadata at scale

We are developing an open-source CLI utility to generate documentation placeholders (YAML, Markdown) for 
the dbt docs site generated by dbt, to assist in documenting Data Vault systems generated by dbtvault.

We also have plans to extend this tool to:

- Generate dbtvault models
- Ingest metadata generated by tools such as Erwin DM, WhereScape and more, to fill in those documentation placeholders.

Development is still ongoing, and we are continually adding more and more features.
If you have any ideas, or are interested in hearing more, contact Datavault directly via Slack or email or submit an 
issue on our GitHub.
