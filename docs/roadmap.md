With each release we will be adding more Data Vault 2.0 table templates, helpful macros and productivity enhancements.
We hope to tailor new features to the requirements of our community, making the package 
the best and most useful it can be.

We will be releasing changes incrementally, so you can reap the benefits as soon as features are developed.
